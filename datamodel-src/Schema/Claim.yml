Claim:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: "A [[Claim]] in Schema.org represents a specific, factually-oriented claim
      that could be the [[itemReviewed]] in a [[ClaimReview]]. The content of a
      claim can be summarized with the [[text]] property. Variations on well
      known claims can have their common identity indicated via [[sameAs]]
      links, and summarized with a [[name]]. Ideally, a [[Claim]] description
      includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity
      or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the
      context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim
      reviews.


      \  Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can be associated with
      related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]] or
      [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].


      \  At this time, Schema.org does not define any types of
      relationship between claims. This is a natural area for future
      exploration.
