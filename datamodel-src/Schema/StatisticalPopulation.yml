StatisticalPopulation:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: "A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that
      satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used
      to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that
      type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a
      [[StatisticalPopulation]] representing all [[Person]]s with a
      [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California, would be described by applying
      the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a
      [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.

      The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constrainingProperty]] are
      used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify
      the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the
      general sense of a statistical

      population, and does not imply that the population consists of
      people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]]
      could be used. See also [[Observation]], and the [data and
      datasets](/docs/data-and-datasets.html) overview for more details.
