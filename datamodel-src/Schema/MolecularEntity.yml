    monoisotopicMolecularWeight:
      type:
        - string
        - QuantitativeValue
      documentation:
        en: The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule
          using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most
          abundant) isotope for each element instead of the isotopic average
          mass. Please include the units the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;',
          for example '770.230488 g/mol' or as '&lt;QuantitativeValue&gt;.
