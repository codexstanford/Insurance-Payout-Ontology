Schedule:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: >-
      A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly
      occurring [[Event]]. At a minimum a schedule will specify
      [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurences of the
      event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more
      precisely.
            This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
            have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.

    scheduleTimezone:
      type: string
      documentation:
        en: Indicates the timezone for which the time(s) indicated in the [[Schedule]]
          are given. The value provided should be among those listed in the IANA
          Time Zone Database.
    startDate:
      type:
        - dateTime
        - date
      documentation:
        en: The start date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date
          format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
    exceptDate:
      type:
        - dateTime
        - date
      documentation:
        en: >-
          Defines a [[Date]] or [[DateTime]] during which a scheduled [[Event]] will
          not take place. The property allows exceptions to
                a [[Schedule]] to be specified. If an exception is specified as a [[DateTime]] then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
                should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a [[Date]] then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
                excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.
    startTime:
      type:
        - dateTime
        - time
      documentation:
        en: The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
          FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start.
          For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed.
          e.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December. For media,
          including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip
          within a larger file.\n\nNote that Event uses startDate/endDate
          instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times.
          This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
    repeatCount:
      type: number
      documentation:
        en: Defines the number of times a recurring [[Event]] will take place
    endDate:

    repeatFrequency:
      type:

      documentation:
        en: >-
          Defines the frequency at which [[Event]]s will occur according to a schedule
          [[Schedule]]. The intervals between
                events should be defined as a [[Duration]] of time.
    duration:
      type: Duration
      documentation:
        en: The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in [ISO 8601

    byMonthDay:
      type: number
      documentation:
        en: Defines the day(s) of the month on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place.
          Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-31.
    endTime:
      type:
        - dateTime
        - time
      documentation:
        en: The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
          FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end.
          For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed.
          e.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*. For media,
          including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip

    byMonth:
      type: number
      documentation:
        en: Defines the month(s) of the year on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place.
          Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-12. January is 1.

        - string
      documentation:
        en: Defines the day(s) of the week on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place.
          May be specified using either [[DayOfWeek]], or alternatively [[Text]]
          conforming to iCal's syntax for byDay recurrence rules.
    byMonthWeek:
      type: number
      documentation:
        en: Defines the week(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place.
          Specified as an Integer between 1-5. For clarity, byMonthWeek is best
          used in conjunction with byDay to indicate concepts like the first and
          third Mondays of a month.
