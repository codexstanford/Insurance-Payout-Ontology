Protein:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino
      acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067),
      eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can
      point to are all of type schema:Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass
      of another protein, e.g. schema:Protein as a UniProt record can have
      multiple isoforms inside it which would also be schema:Protein. They can
      be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.
