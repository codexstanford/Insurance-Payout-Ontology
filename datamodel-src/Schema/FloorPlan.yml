  documentation:
    en: "A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar
      accommodations, allowing the provision of common information (room counts,
      sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. In typical use,
      some [[ApartmentComplex]] has an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a
      [[FloorPlan]].  A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular
      place, either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single [[Apartment]]. The
      visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, [see
      wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan)) can be indicated
      using [[image]]. "
