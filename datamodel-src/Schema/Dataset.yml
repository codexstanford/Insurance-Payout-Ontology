      documentation:
        en: "A technique or technology used in a [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]],
          [[DataCatalog]]),

          corresponding to the method used for measuring the
          corresponding variable(s) (described using [[variableMeasured]]). This
          is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but
          may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full
          representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for
          dataset discovery.


          For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule
          concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass
          spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or
          \"immunofluorescence\".


          If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the
          [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or
          \"Beck Depression Inventory\".


          If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties
          recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each
          [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding
          [[measurementTechnique]].
