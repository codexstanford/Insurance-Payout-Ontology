Grant:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: "A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of resources.
      Typically a [[funder]] sponsors some [[MonetaryAmount]] to an
      [[Organization]] or [[Person]],

      \    sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived
      [[Project]], resulting in one or more outputs, or [[fundedItem]]s. For
      financial sponsorship, indicate the [[funder]] of a [[MonetaryGrant]]. For
      non-financial support, indicate [[sponsor]] of [[Grant]]s of resources
      (e.g. office space).


      Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective
      goals, often but not always organized as [[Project]]s. Long-lived projects
      are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also
      common for a project to be associated with a single grant.


      The amount of a [[Grant]] is represented using [[amount]] as a
      [[MonetaryAmount]].
