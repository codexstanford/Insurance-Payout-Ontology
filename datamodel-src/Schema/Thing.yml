      documentation:

    description:
      type: string

    additionalType:
      type: string
      documentation:
        en: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
          types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a
          relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In
          RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof'
          attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
          understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
    disambiguatingDescription:
      type: string
      documentation:
        en: A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to
          disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other
          properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description
          to be useful for disambiguation.

          [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides
          dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual
          strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background
          notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
