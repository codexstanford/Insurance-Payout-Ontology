ItemList:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: A list of items of any sort&#x2014;for example, Top 10 Movies About
      Weathermen, or Top 100 Party Songs. Not to be confused with HTML lists,
      which are often used only for formatting.
  inherit: Intangible
  properties:
    numberOfItems:
      type: number
      documentation:
        en: The number of items in an ItemList. Note that some descriptions might not
          fully describe all items in a list (e.g., multi-page pagination); in
          such cases, the numberOfItems would be for the entire list.
    itemListElement:
      type:
        - Thing
        - ListItem
        - string
      documentation:
        en: "For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. \"Peter\",
          \"Paul\", \"Mary\"), existing entities, or use ListItem.\\n\\nText
          values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings.
          Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing
          things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want
          to provide additional context about the element in that list or when
          the same item might be in different places in different
          lists.\\n\\nNote: The order of elements in your mark-up is not
          sufficient for indicating the order or elements.  Use ListItem with a
          'position' property in such cases."
    itemListOrder:
      type:
        - string
        - ItemListOrderType
      documentation:
        en: Type of ordering (e.g. Ascending, Descending, Unordered).
