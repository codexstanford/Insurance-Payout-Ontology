    inverseOf:
      type: Property
      documentation:
        en: Relates a property to a property that is its inverse. Inverse properties
          relate the same pairs of items to each other, but in reversed
          direction. For example, the 'alumni' and 'alumniOf' properties are
          inverseOf each other. Some properties don't have explicit inverses; in
          these situations RDFa and JSON-LD syntax for reverse properties can be
          used.
