    dateline:
      type: string
      documentation:
        en: "A [dateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline) is a brief piece of
          text included in news articles that describes where and when the story
          was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only
          a placename is provided.


          Structured representations of dateline-related information
          can also be expressed more explicitly using [[locationCreated]] (which
          represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was
          written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use
          [[contentLocation]].


          Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers
          than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some
          examples: \"BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.\", \"Paris, France\", \"December
          19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington\", \"Beijing/Moscow\",
          \"QUEZON CITY, Philippines\".
