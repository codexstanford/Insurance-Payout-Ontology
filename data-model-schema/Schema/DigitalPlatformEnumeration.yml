      as [[actionPlatform]]. It is not supposed to be comprehensive - when a
      suitable code is not enumerated here, textual or URL values can be used
      instead. These codes are at a fairly high level and do not deal with
      versioning and other nuance. Additional codes can be suggested [in
      github](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3057). "
