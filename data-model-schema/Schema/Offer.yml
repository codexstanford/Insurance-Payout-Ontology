          [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties. The GS1

          GTINs as URLs. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which
          means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or
          14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The
          numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check

          the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN
