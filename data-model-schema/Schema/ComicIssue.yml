      Individual comic issues are serially published as
          	part of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues
          	belong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be
          	uniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the
          	series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant
          	description of the issue (if any).
