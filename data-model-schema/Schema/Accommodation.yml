      An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel
      room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for
      overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement.

      For more specific types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can use additionalType with external vocabularies.
