WebContent:
  type: object
  documentation:
    en: WebContent is a type representing all [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and
      [[WebPageElement]] content. It is sometimes the case that detailed
      distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts is not always
      important or obvious. The  [[WebContent]] type makes it easier to describe
      Web-addressable content without requiring such distinctions to always be
      stated. (The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]]
      and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of
      [[WebContent]]).
