        en: This stands for any day that is a public holiday; it is a placeholder for
          all official public holidays in some particular location. While not
          technically a "day of the week", it can be used with
          [[OpeningHoursSpecification]]. In the context of an opening hours
          specification it can be used to indicate opening hours on public
          holidays, overriding general opening hours for the day of the week on
          which a public holiday occurs.
