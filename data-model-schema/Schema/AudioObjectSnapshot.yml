  documentation:
    en: A specific and exact (byte-for-byte) version of an [[AudioObject]]. Two
      byte-for-byte identical files, for the purposes of this type, considered
      identical. If they have different embedded metadata the files will differ.
      Different external facts about the files, e.g. creator or dateCreated that
      aren't represented in their actual content, do not affect this notion of
      identity.
