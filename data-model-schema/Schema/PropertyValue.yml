      Use the 'name' property for the name of the property. If there is an
      additional human-readable version of the value, put that into the
      'description' property.\\n\\n Always use specific schema.org properties
      when a) they exist and b) you can populate them. Using PropertyValue as a
      substitute will typically not trigger the same effect as using the
      original, specific property.

          A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the
          property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property.
          propertyID can be

          (1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific id of the property), or (3)

          a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).

          Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers of properties from their standards.

          is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but
          may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full
          representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for
          dataset discovery.


          For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule
          concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass
          spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or
          \"immunofluorescence\".


          If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the
          [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or
          \"Beck Depression Inventory\".


          If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties
          recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each
          [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding
          [[measurementTechnique]].
