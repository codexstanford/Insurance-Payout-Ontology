      documentation:
        en: "A Global Trade Item Number
          ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify

          identification codes. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier
          [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties. The GS1
          [digital link
          specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express
          GTINs as URLs. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which
          means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or
          14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The
          numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check
          digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet
          the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN
