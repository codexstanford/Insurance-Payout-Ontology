      A tourist destination. In principle any [[Place]] can be a
      [[TouristDestination]] from a [[City]], Region or [[Country]] to an
      [[AmusementPark]] or [[Hotel]]. This Type can be used on its own to
      describe a general [[TouristDestination]], or be used as an
      [[additionalType]] to add tourist relevant properties to any other
      [[Place]].  A [[TouristDestination]] is defined as a [[Place]] that
      contains, or is colocated with, one or more [[TouristAttraction]]s, often
      linked by a similar theme or interest to a particular [[touristType]]. The
      [UNWTO](http://www2.unwto.org/) defines Destination (main destination of a
      tourism trip) as the place visited that is central to the decision to take
      the trip.
