          FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start.
          For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed.
          e.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December. For media,
          including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip
          within a larger file.\n\nNote that Event uses startDate/endDate
          instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times.
